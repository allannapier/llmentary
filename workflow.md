## üìä Progress Tracking

**Overall Progress:** 3/7 stages completed (43%)

**Current Focus:** Stage 4 - Multiple Storage Backends
**Next Milestone:** Abstract storage interface and Redis/PostgreSQL backends
**Last Completed:** Stage 3 - Advanced drift detection with semantic similarity and severity classification

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

**Per Stage:**
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests with real LLM providers
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates

**Final Integration:**
- End-to-end testing with multiple providers
- Load testing for production scenarios
- Security audit for production deployment

## üìù Notes and Decisions

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Prioritize privacy-first design (hashing by default)
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Clean separation between core monitoring and analysis features

**Technical Debt to Address:**
- Remove duplicate code between llmentary.py and llmentary_simple.py
- Standardize logging throughout codebase
- Add comprehensive type hints
- Update to modern Python patterns (3.8+)
